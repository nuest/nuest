### Hi 👋

I (😄 he/him) am a researcher at the [Spatio-temporal Modelling Lab](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/labs/spatio-temporal-modelling-lab/) at the 📍 [Institute for Geoinformatics]() (ifgi) at the 🏫 [University of Münster](https://uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics). I'm working in the DFG-funded project 🔭 [Opening Reproducible Research](https://o2r.info/) (o2r) on tools for increasing reproducibility of computational workflows in 🗺️ geography and 🌍🌏🌎 geosciences based on ✨ [research compendia](https://research-compendium.science/). I try to adhere to [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) principles and advocate for open reproducible research, mostly in the [R](https://github.com/topics/rstatsgith) and [R-spatial](https://github.com/search?q=r+spatial) communities.

💬 [Get in touch](mailto:daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de) if you want to improve the reproducibility of your research, maybe [using 🐋 containers](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008316)?

I am interested in 🤔 improving the scholarly 📃 publication and 👯 communication process with new 🚀 information technology — of course with ⚡ Open Source software! Before academia, I worked as a consultant and research software enginner at [52°North Initiative for Geospatial Software Solutions GmbH](https://github.com/52north/).

I enjoy playing  🥏 [Ultimate Frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)) — [the greatest sport ever invented by man](https://thegreatestsporteverinvented.com/).
