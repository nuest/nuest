# Hi 👋

I (he/him) am a postdocoral researcher at the [Chair of Geoinformatics](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/umwelt/geo/geoinformatik/?set_language=en) at the 🏫 [Technical University Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/) with the 🌉 [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/) consortium for Earth System Scinces - 🌍 [NFDI4Earth](https://nfdi4earth.de/).
tI'm working on projects to make research in 🗺️ geography, 🌍🌏🌎 geosciences, and 🗺️❤️💻 GIScience more open, reproducible, and discoverable.
I think about both 🗃️💿 data and 🧑‍💻 software to achieve that and have a passion for 🎚️ metadata.
I strive to adhere to 👐 [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) principles and 📢 advocate for open reproducible research and open scholarship.

## ⚙️ Projects

- 🌍 [NFDI4Earth](https://nfdi4earth.de/) addresses digital needs of Earth System Sciences in the German national research data infrastructure ([NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en)) [2022-08 - ..]
- 🟩 [CODECHECK](https://codecheck.org.uk/) is an open community that introduces minimalistic yet effective code execution practices into peer review processes to make science more transparent and reproducible. [Co-PI; 2019- ..]
- In the BMBF-funded projects ⏫ [OPTIMETA](https://projects.tib.eu/optimeta/en/) and ☄️ [KOMET](https://projects.tib.eu/komet) we strengthen the Open Access publishing system through open citations, PIDs, and spatiotemporal metadata by developing plugins for 📄 [Open Journal Systems](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/) (OJS). [PI; 2021-08 - 2025-09]
- In the DFG-funded project 🔭 [Opening Reproducible Research](https://o2r.info/) (o2r) we developed tools for increasing reproducibility of computational workflows in based on ✨ [research compendia](https://research-compendium.science/). [2016-01 - 2022-08]

## 👍 Interests

I am interested in 🤔 improving the scholarly 📃 publication and 👯 communication process with new 🚀 information technology — of course with ⚡ Open Source software!
I completed my 🧑‍🎓 PhD [_Infrastructures and Practices for Reproducible Research in Geography, Geosciences, and GIScience_](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4768095) in 2022 in 👨‍🏫 [Edzer Pebesma's](https://github.com/edzer/) [Spatiotemporal Modelling Lab](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/labs/spatio-temporal-modelling-lab/) at the 📍 [Institute for Geoinformatics]() (ifgi) at the 🏫 [University of Münster](https://uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics).
My publications, CV, memberships, and service are in my [🟢 ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0024-5046).
Before academia, I worked as a consultant and research software engineer at [52°North Spatial Information Research GmbH](https://github.com/52north/).
Because reserach doesn't work without software anymore, I was a vice chair of the German association of research software engineers ([de-RSE](https://de-rse.org/en/)) and am a self-identifying [RSE](https://software.ac.uk/research-software-engineers).

I enjoy playing  🥏 [Ultimate Frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)) — [_the greatest sport ever invented by man_](https://thegreatestsporteverinvented.com/) and prioritise 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧.
