# Hi 👋

I (😄 he/him) am a researcher at the [Spatio-temporal Modelling Lab](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/labs/spatio-temporal-modelling-lab/) at the 📍 [Institute for Geoinformatics]() (ifgi) at the 🏫 [University of Münster](https://uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics). I'm working on projects to make research in 🗺️ geography and 🌍🌏🌎 geosciences more open, reproducible, and accessible.
I strive to adhere to [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) principles and advocate for open reproducible research, mostly in the [R](https://github.com/topics/rstats) and [R-spatial](https://github.com/search?q=r+spatial) communities.

## ⚙️ Projects

- In the DFG-funded project 🔭 [Opening Reproducible Research](https://o2r.info/) (o2r) we develop tools for increasing reproducibility of computational workflows in based on ✨ [research compendia](https://research-compendium.science/). 
- In the BMBF-funded project ⏫ [OPTIMETA](https://projects.tib.eu/optimeta/en/) we strengthen the Open Access publishing system through open citations and spatiotemporal metadata by developing plugins for 📄 [Open Journal Systems](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/) (OJS).

## 👍 Interests

I am interested in 🤔 improving the scholarly 📃 publication and 👯 communication process with new 🚀 information technology — of course with ⚡ Open Source software!
I completed my 🧑‍🎓 PhD [_Infrastructures and Practices for Reproducible Research in Geography, Geosciences, and GIScience_](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4768095) in 2022.
My publications are listed in [my 🟢 ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0024-5046).
Before academia, I worked as a consultant and research software enginner at [52°North Spatial Information Research GmbH](https://github.com/52north/).

I enjoy playing  🥏 [Ultimate Frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)) — [the greatest sport ever invented by man](https://thegreatestsporteverinvented.com/).
